## An innovative web-app that helps students at MIT

### How might we help students on MIT?
Creating value for students and for school.

### How can we create added value?
We have to define student’s goals and needs/pain points.

### Students needs/pain points
* Students might not be able to take notes for every lecture for many reasons (sickness, work, etc.).
* On the Fronter you can find lesson plans and PDFs, but they don’t give you enough information.
* This lack becomes especially bad when you have to study for an exam and you miss some note.

### Our goal…
…is to help students providing them notes and information about every lecture. 
We want to do this by making a collaborative notebook in which everyone can share their material (as tasks, notes, code snippets and pictures).

### Student outcome
* We think that with our web-app students can easily confront each other and share their knowledge, getting a richer and more complete learning experience.
* Having access to all this content can also reduce the differences of knowledge between students of the same class. 

### School outcome
We believe that a higher number of students will pass the exams with better grades thanks to our web-app, and this makes a lot of added value for the school.

### Which features will create the desired outcomes? 
* Must haves
    * Login system for students (each user assigned to a class)
    * Students can upload information about every lecture as:
        * Bullet points
        * Code
        * Plain text
        * Pictures
* Nice to have
    * Admin account (who is the one telling the system which classes have which subjects)
    * Being able to see info from other classes, but without writing permissions
* Nice to have but we will never have time to do these things anyway
    * Fronter integration (same login, get the classes, etc.)

### How it’s made
* Different programming languages like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, SQL
* OOP paradigm
* Database
* Github to synchronize the development of the web-app and make the code open-source

### How it’s structured
* Code structure…
* Database structure…
